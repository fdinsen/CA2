            <h1>Sprint/Phase-Planning</h1>
            <h2>Phase one (Monday 19/10-Tuesday 20/10): </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on your deployed project.</li>
                <li>The SCRUM plan for the three mini-sprints must be available as a page on your deployed project. This can either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Sprint-1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining sprints if your “product owner” agrees (red students).</li>
                <li>The CI-pipeline must be setup</li>
                <li>Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests</li>
                <li>Be excellent to each other, and party on dudes!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Phase two (Wednesday 21/10-Thursday 22/10):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the Entity Classes should be ready</li>
                <li>Sample data should be available in the dev-database</li>
                <li>Some of the endpoints (as a minimum a GET, POST and PUT) must be ready with the corresponding DTO’s and integrations tests</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Phase three (Friday 23/10 - Sunday 25/10):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the API (as much as you have time for)</li>
                <li>Implement a simple SPA which as a minimum must have the ability to use some of your GET endpoints and at least one POST endpoint. Consider pages like:</li>
                <li>Get all persons with a given hobby</li>
                <li>Get all phone numbers for a person living in a given city (i.e. 2800 Lyngby)</li>
                <li>Get the number of people with a given hobby</li>
                <li>Get a list of all zip codes in Denmark</li>
                <li>Create a Person (with hobbies, phone, address etc.)</li>
                <li>Edit a Person to change hobbies and phone number etc.</li>
                <li>Complete documentation and prepare for your review presentation Monday 23rd.</li>
